The web app uses Streamlit and ML models to predict diseases based on symptoms, health data, or test results. Users select a disease from the sidebar and input details. Trained on historical data, it detects Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinsonâ€™s, and more, aiding in early diagnosis and timely medical attention. ðŸš€

### Abstract:
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning and deep learning -based application designed to predict various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease, kidney disease, pneumonia, and other conditions based on symptoms. Using Streamlit as the front-end framework, the system provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input relevant medical data or symptoms. The model then processes this data and delivers predictive insights, helping in early diagnosis and awareness. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and accessible solution for preliminary disease assessment.

## Research Paper: Multiple Disease Prediction Webapp 
- **Description:** A study that developed a web application capable of predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, liver disease, jaundice, and hepatitis, using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The system allows users to input data for a specific disease, and based on the trained model, the output is displayed. The paper also discusses the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, as well as the architecture design and implementation details.
